## Case Studies and Verification
To assess the practical capability of our model, we conducted case studies to identify potential interactions for specific drugs/targets. The raw prediction scores for these case studies are provided in the [`case_study_scores/`](./case_study_scores) directory.

**Verification Process:**
The top-ranked predicted interactions were validated by cross-referencing them with the **DrugBank** database. We searched for evidence of these interactions in the database to confirm the biological relevance of our predictions.
